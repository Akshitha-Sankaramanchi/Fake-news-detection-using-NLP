# ABSTRACT
The Fake News Detection System presented in this project harnesses natural language processing and machine learning techniques to discern between authentic and deceptive news articles.Leveraging a diverse set of features such as linguistic patterns, sentiment analysis, and source credibility, the system employs supervised learning algorithms like logistic regression and decision trees to train a robust model. Unsupervised learning methods, including clustering algorithms, are also integrated for anomaly detection. The system operates in real-time, evaluating news content against a trained model to identify misinformation.This Fake News Detection System contributes to the ongoing efforts to combat misinformation and fortify the reliability of news sources in
the digital age.
